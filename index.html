This power generation system works due to the blades that absorb kinetic energy from wind force that in turn rotates the blades, which move a shaft,converting it into mechanical energy that drives a generator producing electricity. The generator basically consists of a magnet and a coil that, when rotating one another, produce electric current. The current produced will be directed to a transformation station and finally distributed by the electricity grid.&nbsp;</p><p>A wind farm can be used in three different systems, each of these systems as differents purposes and energy potential. An isolated system is a system that is deprived of electricity from the public grid, being used only to supply certain regions. A hybrid system produces electricity simultaneously with more than one source of energy, could it be photovoltaic panels or wind turbines. The last one it's the Grid-connected system. These systems are responsible to insert the energy they produce into the public grid. Electricity production through wind energy has several advantages, mainly that it is a renewable source and it empowers the decreased dependence on fossil fuels and that it does not have such a severe negative impact on the environment improving the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere.&nbsp; 
</p><p>Among renewable sources, this energy is the most advanced technology that has a great return on investment and can offer a more interesting and competitive kWh cost compared to non-renewable sources.   Regarding the disadvantages of wind energy, we have noise caused by equipment operation that is disruptive to local people and fauna, and visual pollution as wind farms are installed in free areas to make the most of wind. Some consider that a wind farm has a huge visual impact, that affects the natural landscape and therefore its impact should be considered. However, with the advance of new technologies, even these disadvantages can be minimized. The concern about the growing sustainable development has been acting as a stimulus in the production of new sources of energy. In the national and international situation, the demand for new energy sources has attracted the attention of investors through tax incentives together with government initiatives. &nbsp;</p><p>

Although offshore wind turbines are more expensive to install and maintain due to the sea conditions.<div>There are several advantages to invest on Offshore technology . Starting with the quality of the wind, which tends to be of greater intensity and more stable at sea due to the lack of barriers, which consequently causes an increase in production per unit installed. Offshore wind turbines can still increase significantly, as it is easier to transport large components dimensions by sea instead of land transport. Offshore wind turbines are installed in high seas in shallow waters and away from the coast, marine traffic routes, strategic naval facilities and areas of ecological interest. Offshore turbines are installed where there is not exactly a limit to its dimensions, something that is imposed on the land. Further offshore can also eliminate visual and sound impacts which can lead to further modification of the design of the turbine in order to increase their efficiency. Still exists a large area available for the installation of large wind.
</div><div>In contrast, submarine cable connections as well as which requires maritime foundations which consequently increase installation costs, as well as network integration and further need to increase network capacity offshore.
</div><div>The construction and maintenance of offshore windfarms are also conditioned by the conditions and have more complex accesses for maintenance assistance.</div><div><strong><br></strong></div></div>

                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The gravity foundation works by using its own weight to stabilize the wind, wave, and ice forces that act on the tower.
<br>A steel or concrete box is dipped to the bottom of the sea and is filled with stones, concrete or other high-density material. This type of foundation is vulnerable to erosion at the base that is caused by water currents. Therefore, further preparation of the seabed is necessary, creating a horizontal surface with greater resistance to the effect of currents.&nbsp;<br><br>The main advantages of this type of foundation are: <br>• Simpler removal (not fixed to the seabed); 
<br>• Good corrosion resistance of concrete; 
<br>• More economical construction.
<br><br><br>The main disadvantages of this type of foundation are:
<br>•	Need for prior preparation of the installation site;
<br>•	Expensive installation;

<br>The monopile foundation can be used in a variety of bed conditions, such as mixtures of stones, sand or clay. As long as the foundation is deployed at a depth of 10 to 40 meters on the bottom substrate there will be no problems in areas with large sediment movements.
<br>Compared to gravity foundations, monopiles have less environmental impact.&nbsp;<br><br>The main advantages of this type of foundation are:
<br>•	Easy of manufacture;
<br>•	Easy of transport;
<br>•	Lower cost than other alternatives;
<br>•	It does not require seabed preparation.
<br>
<br>The main disadvantages of this type of foundation are:
<br>•	Need for protection against erosion;
<br>•	The environmental impact caused during its installation;

The connection to ground is made by tubes of smaller diameter compared to a monopile foundation. One of the greatest advantages of a tripod foundation in relation to gravity and monopile foundation is that it can be deployed in deeper zones. In a depth range of 20 to 40 meters the tripod foundation can have a technical and economic advantage.

 Structure</h4>
                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Jacket foundations are standard in the oil and gas industry and have been adapted for offshore turbines. It is a tower anchored at the bottom of the sea and is usually composed of four main legs and secondary bars that are connected by welding or molded sleeves that are assembled prior to transportation to the site.
<br>A transition piece is mounted between the tower and the foundation to ensure proper force transfer.
<br>
<br>The main advantages of this type of foundation are:
<br>•	High resistance to moments;
<br>•	Applicable to depths greater than those allowed by gravity or pile foundations only;
<br>•	Rigid and stable support structure.
<br>
<br>The main disadvantages of this type of foundation are:
<br>•	Complex fabrication structure due to the high number of nodes to be welded;
<br>•	Not suitable for ice zones as the area at the waterline level is high.&nbsp;<br></p>

The focus of the project's innovation is based on the development of a semi-submersible and triangular floating platform, originating from the oil and gas extraction industry, which houses a wind turbine with several MW of production capacity. 
<br>
<br>The floating platform is anchored to the seabed and its stability is achieved through a water-filled gate system at the base of the three pillars, coupled with a static and dynamic ballast system. 
<br>These platforms are designed for risk reduction, both in the construction phase, as well as in the installation and operation phase. 
<br>
<br>These platforms are designed for risk reduction, both in the construction phase, as well as in the installation and operation phase. Thus, WindFloat technology is independent of wind turbine used and of the site and installation depth, it has stability due to water ballast and stabilizing plates at the base of the columns. And the construction is made entirely on land, including turbine mounting, leading to a simplified installation process, thus avoiding difficult and costly offshore work.</p>

                     <p class="p-3">Wind energy potential is used globally as a clean and green energy resource for the production of electricity. In Portugal, since 2000, wind technology has achieved remarkable growth, making the country one of the main drivers of this sector at the European level. This was due to incentives from European and National policy on endogenous and renewable resources aimed at diversifying sources, improving the security of supply, reducing energy dependency and reducing the environmental impact of the power system.</p>

                     <p class="p-3">Targets have been set for renewable energy generation by the European Parliament and the EU Council. These targets state that by the year 2030, 35% of the energy produced in Portugal must come from renewable sources.
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Currently, there are about 250 active wind farms that correspond to an installed capacity of 5.3 GW, about 19%, corresponding to 339.52MW. between 15 and 20 years. This factor urges that the national wind sector is aging and that this trend tends to prosper.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p-3"><br></p>

                     <p class="p-3">Although there are other factors that make it possible to operate after 20 years, there is no legislation that guarantees the extension of wind turbine life safely for all wind farm operators, which makes their maintenance difficult.
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Looking at the short term, the extension of the wind turbine's lifetime will not be permanent, and by 2023 about 72% of wind farms in Portugal will be over 15 years old.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">In a situation where no new investments occur, it is expected that the national wind sector will decline radically over the next few years, diverging from the imposed targets.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p-3"><br></p>
